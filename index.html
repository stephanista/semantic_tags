  	  <p>How is this an article? "An article represents a self-contained
composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples
include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry."</p>

  	  <p>I'm putting blank lines between my elements but also my paragraphs.
Seems like I just need to put them between elements that need to open and close.
What about things like line breaks though? And how far to the right do I go on
a paragraph before I push enter? This is the end of the "article". Let's
<em>try emphasis</em>.</p>
