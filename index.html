      <p>How is this an article? "An article represents a self-contained
composition in a document, page, application, or site, which is intended to be
independently distributable or reusable (e.g., in syndication). Examples
include: a forum post, a magazine or newspaper article, or a blog entry."</p>

      <p>I'm putting blank lines between my elements but also my paragraphs.
Seems like I just need to put them between elements that need to open and close.
What about things like line breaks though? And how far to the right do I go on
a paragraph before I push enter within my editor? This is the end of the "article".
Let's <em>try emphasis</em>.</p>

    <ul>
      <li><sup>superscript</sup> and <sub>subscript</sub> would be handy for math and chemistry</li>
      <li><u>Underlined</u> words will make them stand out</li>
      <li><mark>Marked</mark> words remind me of high school textbooks</li>
      <li><s>Striked</s> ones hearken back to my Geocities days</li>
    </ul>
